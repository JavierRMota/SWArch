== Overview

Decorator Pattern enables you to easily add an enhancement to an existing object.
The Decorator pattern also allows you to layer features atop one another so that
you can construct objects that have exactly the right set of capabilities that
you need for any given situation

The UML diagram for this programming activity is as follows:
